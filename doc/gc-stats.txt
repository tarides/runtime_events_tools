NAME
       olly-gc-stats - Report the GC latency profile and stats.

SYNOPSIS
       olly gc-stats [OPTION]… [EXECUTABLE]…

DESCRIPTION
       Report the GC latency profile.

       Wall time
           Real execution time of the program

       CPU time
           Total CPU time across all domains

       GC time
           Total time spent by the program performing garbage collection
           (major and minor)

       GC overhead
           Percentage of time taken up by GC against the total execution time

       GC time per domain
           Time spent by every domain performing garbage collection (major
           and minor cycles). Domains are reported with their domain ID (e.g.
           `Domain 0`)

       GC latency profile
           Mean, standard deviation and percentile latency profile of GC
           events.

       GC allocations
           GC allocation and promotion in machine words during program
           execution. Counts of Compactions, and Minor and Major collections.

ARGUMENTS
       EXECUTABLE
           Executable and arguments to trace.

OPTIONS
       -a [directory:]pid, --attach=[directory:]pid
           Attach to the process with the given PID. The directory containing
           the PID.events file may be specified. This option cannot be
           combined with EXECUTABLE.

       -d dir, --dir=dir
           Sets the directory where the .events files containing the runtime
           event tracing system’s ring buffers will be located. If not
           specified a temporary directory will be used.

       --freq=freq (absent=0.1)
           Set the interval that olly sleeps in seconds, after performing a
           [Runtime_events.read_poll]. Fractions of seconds are supported. A
           value of 0.0 will skip sleeping altogether.

       --json
           Print the output in json instead of human-readable format.

       --log-wsize=log-wsize
           Size of the per-domain runtime events ring buffers in log powers
           of two words. Defaults to 16.

       -o output, --output=output
           Redirect the output of `olly` to specified file. The output of the
           command is not redirected.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to all commands.

       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

MORE HELP
       Use olly COMMAND --help for help on a single command.
EXIT STATUS
       olly gc-stats exits with:

       0   on success.

       123 on indiscriminate errors reported on standard error.

       124 on command line parsing errors.

       125 on unexpected internal errors (bugs).
