ARGUMENTS
       EXECUTABLE
           Executable and arguments to trace.

       TRACEFILE (required)
           Target trace file name.

OPTIONS
       -a [directory:]pid, --attach=[directory:]pid
           Attach to the process with the given PID. The directory containing
           the PID.events file may be specified. This option cannot be
           combined with EXECUTABLE.

       -c, --emit-counters
           Emit runtime counter events.

       -d dir, --dir=dir
           Sets the directory where the .events files containing the runtime
           event tracing system’s ring buffers will be located. If not
           specified a temporary directory will be used.

       -f format, --format=format (absent=fuchsia)
           Format of the target trace, options are: "fuchsia" (Perfetto),
           "json" (Chrome Trace Format).

       --freq=freq (absent=0.1)
           Set the interval that olly sleeps in seconds, after performing a
           [Runtime_events.read_poll]. Fractions of seconds are supported. A
           value of 0.0 will skip sleeping altogether.

       --log-wsize=log-wsize
           Size of the per-domain runtime events ring buffers in log powers
           of two words. Defaults to 16.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to all commands.

       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.
